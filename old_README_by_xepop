v2.14
- fixed: didn't do savepoints sometimes and instead used old one in that slot

v2.11
- removed output to stdout and stderr that was introduced in 2.09 accidentally

v2.09
- actually really finally fixed: everything in bruteforce (it still sucks though)
- fixed: crash on in bruteforce dialog on linux
- fixed: major savegame desyncs in some maps

v2.06, 25.8.2013
- really fixed bruteforce use and damage

v2.03, 23.8.2013
- fixed bruteforce use


Key config file:
%appdata% for windows users
$HOME/.xdre for linux users


Known issues:
- trying to shutdown xdre from "doom" window will fuck everything up; don't do that!
- -128 looks like acceptable value for run and strafe, however it is not. I'm just lazy

Savepoints:
- User: You manage everything yourself.
- Start: Saves on map start automatically, should be safe to use. You can also make your own savepoints
- Auto: Saves automatically every now and then

Bruteforce:
- separator "," | e.g 50,49,48,47,25,-50,-7
- range ":" | e.g 50:0,-25:-50
- strafe: left-to-right (-50:50 = sl50...sr50, 50:-50 = sr50...sl50)
- run: backward-to-forward
- turn: right-to-left //do not ask me why, that's just how it is
